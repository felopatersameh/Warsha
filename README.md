# Car Repair Mediator Website

## Overview
This project involved developing a front-end website that serves as a mediator between car owners and automotive repair centers. The site facilitates seamless communication between users needing vehicle repairs and the service centers that provide those services. Our goal was to enhance user experience by simplifying the process of booking, managing, and reviewing car repair services online.

## Key Features
- **Booking System**: Users can book repair appointments directly through the website.
- **Repair Center Listings**: Comprehensive directory of repair centers with location and service information.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The front-end is designed to be simple, responsive, and easy to navigate.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Users receive updates about their repair status.
- **Review System**: Car owners can rate and review repair centers after services are rendered.
